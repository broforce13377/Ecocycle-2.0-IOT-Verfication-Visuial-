# Ecocycle-2.0-IOT-Verfication-Visuial-
📱 EcoCycle Application – IoT Verification & Scanner Interfaces

This repository represents part of the EcoCycle 2.0 application, a smart sustainability platform designed to support responsible waste disposal through the integration of IoT, AI, and user-centered interface design.

The application focuses on visual and auditory feedback to clearly communicate system status and verification outcomes to users during the recycling process.

🔍 What This Repository Contains

This repository includes:

✅ Source code for the IoT QR Visual Verification page, where users scan a smart bin QR code and receive real-time feedback on:

Detected weight

Material match

Verification success

EcoCredits awarded


🎯 Purpose of the Implementation

The goal of this implementation is to demonstrate how frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) can be used to simulate real-time IoT verification interactions, making invisible system processes (such as sensor validation and transaction confirmation) visible, intuitive, and trustworthy for users.

This interface was developed as part of an academic Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) project, emphasizing:

Clear system feedback

Error prevention

User confidence and transparency

Alignment with smart-city and sustainability use cases
